        #   has a time to handle it (this will also throw off a lot of inotify
        #   code, though)
        #
        # * Moving a watched directory within a watched directory will get the
        #   wrong path.  This needs to use the cookie system to link events
        #   together and complete the move properly, which can still make some
        #   events get the wrong path if you get file events during the move or
        #   something silly like that, since MOVED_FROM and MOVED_TO aren't
        #   guaranteed to be contiguous.  That exercise is left up to the
        #   reader.
        #
        # * Trying to watch a path that doesn't exist won't automatically
        #   create it or anything of the sort.
        #
        # * Deleting and recreating or moving the watched directory won't do
        #   anything special, but it probably should.
