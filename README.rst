asyncinotify
============

An async python inotify package.  Kept as simple and easy-to-understand as
possible, while still being flexible and powerful.  This is built on no external
dependencies, and works through ctypes in a very obvious fashion.

This depends on Python 3.6+ features, and will not work with prior versions.

This works without any other external dependencies.

The code is available on GitLab_ and the documentation is available on
ReadTheDocs_. The package itself is available on PyPi_.
